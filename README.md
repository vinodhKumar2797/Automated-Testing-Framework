# Automated Testing Framework

## Project Description

This project is a comprehensive Automated Testing Framework designed to deliver reliable and maintainable UI test automation using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles. The framework leverages:

- **Cucumber JVM** for defining human-readable feature files in Gherkin syntax,
- **Selenium WebDriver** for browser automation,
- **TestNG** for test execution and orchestration,
- **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern to encapsulate UI elements and interactions,
- **WebDriverManager** for automatic management of browser driver binaries,
- **Log4j2** for detailed logging,
- **Maven** for dependency and build management.

The framework is structured to support scalable microservice testing with living documentation and encourages best practices for automated test development.
